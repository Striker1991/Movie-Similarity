# Movie-Similarity
Data provided will be used to recommend movies similar to each other.  So, we can make a recommendation system like if any user has liked a particular movie, we will list out some similar types of movies to the user. The idea behind is to form a recommendation engine such that when we look at every case where a user has rated the specified movie, and look at the other movies that he has rated,  we jot out a list of other similar movies with the specified ratings. Hence we use the process flow described in the code section to form a simple recommendation engine.
